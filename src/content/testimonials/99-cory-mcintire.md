Working with Alex was always a pleasure, easy to talk through issues with, and always came with not just good information resulting from excellent troubleshooting, but would deliver solutions as well. That sort of commitment just isn't common and is a real asset to Alex's work, and would be an extremely benefiicial asset to anyone lucky enough to have them on their team.
